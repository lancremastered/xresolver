<h1>xResolver - Xbox/PSN Resolver and Gamertag IP Puller</h1>

An IP/DNS/Gamertag Resolver is a server or database on the Internet that converts domain names and Gamertags into IP addresses, and vice versa. xResolver is an online website designed to resolve Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s Playstation Gamertags and usernames into a readable IP format.

xResolver, however originated back in 2017, dispersed on 2 different domain names, one for Xbox and one for PSN. The reverse lookups wasn’t very successful at the time, as players themselves store these IP/Gamertag entries by using an IP puller called Octosniff. As Octosniff became more and more popular, in fact, the number one IP sniffer in the last two years, so did xResolver’s database grow, exponentially.

Now boasting over 20 million entries, you are more than likely to find yourself on their services, and ultimately, be susceptible to IP booters and party kickers. While the website service is controversial to many, it is completely legal to list public information. It is up to the users to not misuse this information and follow the recommended guidelines on protecting themselves against such tools and attacks.
